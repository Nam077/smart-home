# Common Module

## Overview
The `common` module contains shared components that can be used throughout the application. It includes data transfer objects (DTOs), interceptors, interfaces, and services that are commonly used across different parts of the application.

## Structure
- **dto**: Contains data transfer objects used for data validation and transformation.
- **interceptors**: Includes interceptors for modifying requests or responses.
- **interfaces**: Defines interfaces for type-checking and ensuring consistent implementations.
- **services**: Provides common services that can be utilized by other modules.

## Usage
This module is intended to be imported and used by other modules in the application to maintain consistency and reduce code duplication.

## Contribution
Contributions to the `common` module should focus on adding reusable components that can benefit multiple parts of the application.
