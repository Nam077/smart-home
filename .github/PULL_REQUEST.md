## Implementation Details

### 1. MQTT Service Implementation
- Configured Aedes MQTT broker with dual protocol support:
  - TCP MQTT server on port 1883
  - WebSocket MQTT server on port 8883
- Implemented secure device communication with:
  - Client authentication
  - Topic-based access control
  - Message validation
  - Error handling

#### Message Types and Topics
- Standardized topic structure: `home/{roomId}/{deviceId}/{type}`
- Implemented topic types:
  ```typescript
  enum TopicTypeEnum {
    BROADCAST = 'broadcast',
    CONTROL = 'control',
    CONFIG = 'config',
    STATUS = 'status',
    DATA = 'data',
    ERROR = 'error'
  }
  ```
- Supported command types:
  ```typescript
  enum CommandTypeEnum {
    // Broadcast Commands
    TURN_OFF_ALL = 'turn_off_all',
    TURN_ON_ALL = 'turn_on_all',
    
    // Connection Commands
    DEVICE_CONNECT = 'device_connect',
    DEVICE_DISCONNECT = 'device_disconnect',
    
    // Unicast Commands
    SET_STATUS = 'set_status',
    SET_BRIGHTNESS = 'set_brightness',
    SET_SPEED = 'set_speed',
    SET_TEMPERATURE = 'set_temperature',
    SET_VALUE = 'set_value',
    GET_STATUS = 'get_status',
    GET_INFO = 'get_info',
    
    // Config Commands
    UPDATE_CONFIG = 'update_config',
    SYNC_TIME = 'sync_time'
  }
  ```

#### Connection Management
- Implemented device connection handling:
  ```typescript
  // Device Connection Message
  {
    "command": "device_connect",
    "deviceInfo": {
      "ipAddress": "192.168.1.100",
      "macAddress": "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF",
      "firmwareVersion": "1.0.0"  // optional
    },
    "timestamp": "2024-01-20T12:00:00Z"
  }
  ```
- Real-time connection tracking
- Automatic disconnection detection
- Last seen time updates
- Connection status persistence

#### Message Handling
- Implemented comprehensive message handlers:
  - Device status updates
  - Control commands
  - Configuration changes
  - Error reporting
- Added message validation and transformation
- Implemented retry mechanisms
- Added error logging and monitoring

### 2. Device Management System
- Created complete CRUD operations for device management
- Implemented real-time status tracking and history
- Added support for multiple device types:
  - SENSOR: Environmental and state sensors
  - ACTUATOR: Control and automation devices
- Implemented device functions:
  - RELAY: On/Off control
  - SENSOR: Data collection
  - DIMMER: Brightness control
  - RGB: Color control

#### Device Status Updates
```typescript
{
  "status": "on" | "off",
  "brightness": number,
  "temperature": number,
  "speed": number,
  "value": number,
  "timestamp": "2024-01-20T12:00:00Z"
}
```

### 3. Control System
- Implemented device control handlers for various commands:
  ```typescript
  // Status Control
  {
    "command": "set_status",
    "value": true | false,
    "timestamp": "2024-01-20T12:00:00Z"
  }

  // Brightness Control
  {
    "command": "set_brightness",
    "value": 0-100,
    "timestamp": "2024-01-20T12:00:00Z"
  }

  // Temperature Control
  {
    "command": "set_temperature",
    "value": number,
    "timestamp": "2024-01-20T12:00:00Z"
  }

  // Speed Control
  {
    "command": "set_speed",
    "value": number,
    "timestamp": "2024-01-20T12:00:00Z"
  }

  // Color Control
  {
    "command": "set_color",
    "value": {
      "r": 0-255,
      "g": 0-255,
      "b": 0-255
    },
    "timestamp": "2024-01-20T12:00:00Z"
  }
  ```

  - `control.retry`: Command retry initiated

## Technical Details

### MQTT Configuration
```env
MQTT_HOST=localhost
MQTT_PORT=1883
MQTT_WS_PORT=8883
MQTT_USERNAME=mqtt_user
MQTT_PASSWORD=mqtt_password
API_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### Message Flow
1. Client sends control command to MQTT topic
2. Command is validated and processed
3. Device state is updated in database
4. Status update is published to relevant topics
5. WebSocket events notify connected clients
6. Retry mechanism handles failed commands
